Bachelor Degree Final Thesis’ project aimed to improve the accessibility in public spaces, specially focused in public transport, by using Beacons and an iPhone App. 

The user can download information, named Service, regarding some area or place (train stations, bus stops, an airport) so the App can detect the Beacons linked to that Service and notify the user with very specific information about where is the user located or what is around him/her. For example, if the user downloads a Service of a train service, the App will notify the user when detecting a related Beacon in the train platform which platform is he/she at, lines calling at that platform and time left for the next train.
